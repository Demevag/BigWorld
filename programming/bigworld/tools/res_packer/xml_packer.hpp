/**
 *	This class converts all files begining with a '<' to a packed XML section.
 *	It adds itself to the packers as a LOWEST_PRIORITY packer, so it should be
 *	the last one to be executed, trying to process any file extension that
 *  hasn't been caught by the other packers. It also copies sections that are
 *	already packed.
 *	It is important that this class adds itself as LOWEST_PRIORITY, to allow
 *	other packers, such as the ChunkPacker, to process its XML-based file(s)
 *	first.
