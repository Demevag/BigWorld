     *	stable.  The decompression method should be able to handle older
     *	formats but the	compression method always compresses using the best
     *	known compression method.  Currently the compression is done by
     *	quantising the heights to 1mm intervals and compressing the resultant
     *	integerised height map using PNG.  Typically this gives a compression
     *	ratio of 8:1.
