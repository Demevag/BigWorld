// When a line wants to expand/contract, it has to negotiate with the adjacent

// column in question is busy, then the line just has to wait for it to be
// done I guess ... or else invent some other trickier corner ownership scheme?
// That could work if the rect stayed centered and always grew as a square,
// but since neither of those are likely to be true, I think we will have to
// stick with this dodgy negotiation thing. Hmm this idea isn't nearly as
// attractive any more. Maybe it should just pick one edge at a time and
// expand that one? Let's stick with the 4 edges idea for now.
// Right, I reckon the line can always take the corners over - if it's in the
// middle of loading/unloading that column, then great, that's probably what
// that line wanted to do with it anyway.

    // Basic description:

    // the new algorithm works with two rectangles, being the queued-to-load
    // rectangle and the fully-loaded rectangle. the former is used to load
    // more chunks, the latter to unload chunks. the interiors of both
    // rectangles are always considered to be filled in, so only the lines
    // of the four working edges need to be stored. when its line is complete
    // (or emptied), the rectangle moves to incorporate or exclude that line

    // not sure if two distinct rectangles are really the way to go... what
    // happens if you want to change direction and start unloading when there
    // are still some queued-to-load chunks that haven't made it into the
    // fully-loaded rectangle yet? hmmmm...

    // oh, and there is not one rectangle per space, there is one rectangle
    // per GeometryMapping, so there are no issues with grid alignment.

    // also need to do something funky with a new geometry mapping - wait
    // until all cells have loaded all chunks before considering it for
    // restricting load balancing. not entirely sure how that's going to work

    // ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Further thoughts:

    // if we always scan from L to R, all we need to keep is a fixed small
    // number of in-flight records (can be a map, or even don't bother with
    // that), and then how far we are up to along each edge. yep that'll be
    // cool. this also solves the problem of reversing direction - those
    // map entries just stay 'busy' until the gird square has finished its
    // full loading rigmarole at which point it can be discarded.
    // ok, now how do we avoid unloading inside chunks that have multiple
    // chunks referring to them? probably just check around at the time,
    // rather than adding a ChunkCache to keep a reference count like that.

    // it would be good if each little op was ordered and directly reversible
    // from any point... that way we don't have to wait for a chunk to load
    // if we've changed our mind and now want to unload it. just have a
    // 'direction' flag in it which it looks at for each chunk tick to
    // decide what to do next. obviously you can't get chunks back from the
    // queue after you've started to load them, so we'll always have to wait
    // for that to complete, but it doesn't mean we then have to go and submit
    // all its overlappers and also wait for them to complete before we unload
