 *

 *
 *	AI Control can be transferred to the vehicle in script if required, or left
 *	with the another Entity (eg, inside bus as passenger) or the vehicle itself
 *	(eg, moving platform).
 *
 *	An Entity may only use one vehicle at a time.  However, many Entities can
 *	be a passenger of the same vehicle. If the vehicle is destroyed, all
 *	passengers will be forced to alight.
 *
 *	This method raises a TypeError if the entity is not a real entity, or if
