/**
 *	This class allows arbitrary extension of the entity class.
 *	It can exist on both real and ghost entities, but is never ghosted.
 *	Use a controller and get it to register itself with your EntityExtra
 *	if you want to have ghosted data.
 *	EntityExtras are owned by their entity, so if the entity disappears
 *	you will be mercilessly deleted. You may also delete yourself at any time.
 *
 *	Derived classes of derived classes of EntityExtra are not supported,
 *	because of the ambiguity of resolving Python touch attributes,
 *	as well as other similar problems. If a good reason was found to change
 *	this stance then it could happen, but won't until something comes up.
