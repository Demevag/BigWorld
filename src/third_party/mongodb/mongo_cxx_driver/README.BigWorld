# This README file describes the steps to build the MongoDB C++ library from
# source tar ball, which was downloaded from https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver
# You should build the boost library before building this library.

# TODO: Create a Makefile to automatically build this library to replace
# these manual steps.

# Step 1: extract the tar ball
tar zxf mongo-cxx-driver-legacy-0.0-26compat-2.6.7.tar.gz

# Step 2: rename the directory and apply the patch. The patch is required to
# work around an error triggered by -Wextra flag. If the driver is updated in
# future, the patch would be not necessary anymore.
mv mongo-cxx-driver-legacy-0.0-26compat-2.6.7 mongo_cxx_driver
patch mongo_cxx_driver/src/mongo/client/connpool.h < ./mongo_cxx_driver.patch

# Step 3: build the library. cpppath points to boost source directory for header
# including, and libpath is path to built boost library files.
cd mongo_cxx_driver/
scons --c++11=C++11 --full --use-system-boost --prefix=$PWD/../build --libpath=../../boost/build/lib --cpppath=../../boost/boost_1_54_0
