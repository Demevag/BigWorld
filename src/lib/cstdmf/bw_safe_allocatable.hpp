     *	This provides a class to inherit from that ensures that allocations
     *	and deallocations of class instances use the BigWorld memory allocator,
     *	avoiding an issue when a class in a DLL is allocated by the DLL-loading
     *	application, but deleted by code within the DLL.
     *
     *	Note that Visual Studio inlines 'operator delete' at build-time in non-
     *	Debug builds for virtual base classes, so merely calling 'new' and
     *'delete' in the application isn't enough to avoid this problem.
     *
     *	As an alternative to using this class, the ensure class can be exported
     *	in the DLL, and given a virtual destructor, in which case Visual Studio
     *	should not inline the 'operator delete' for the class.
