/**
 *	This file implement the quadtree.
 *
 *	Possible memory reductions:
 *		- Reduce the depth of the tree that is being used.
 *		- In the calculateQTRange function, for large objects they can be scaled
 *			up so that they do not make as many leaf nodes.
 *		- When inserting objects, we do not need to go down to the maximum
 *			depth. We could stop when there are no other objects in the subtree
 *			(or a certain number).
 *		- We know that nodes at the maximum depth do not have any children so we
 *			could have a QuadTreeNode class without these pointers. This would
 *			involve casting (or the addition of virtual methods with the memory
 *			and small CPU costs).
 *		- The VC++7 implementation of BW::vector takes 16 bytes when empty. We
 *			could look at having internal nodes having a fixed length array. If
 *			they had four, this would use the same amount of memory if the
 *			vectors were empty. If they overflowed, you would have to put them
 *			in child nodes. (This would cost 4 times as much).
 *		- An alternative to the previous option is for (internal nodes) they
 *			could keep a pointer to a vector. They only create it when
 *			necessary. This would cost 4 bytes for those nodes that are empty
 *			and 20 bytes for those that aren't. Nodes at the maximum depth would
 *			always have a collection.
 *		- We could just insert the objects until they would be split over nodes.
 *			This could be bad for nodes that overlap the centre point but the
 *			benefits include that we could keep the elements in a quadtree node
 *			as a linked-list with the next pointer actually in the
 *			ChunkObstacle. This would also get rid of the need for the 4 byte
 *			mark in ChunkObstacles.
 *
 *	Thoughts on speed:
 *		- We should look at how memory is allocated and maybe look at doing a
 *			custom allocator. Could also do batch adds.
 *
 *	Thoughts on cleanup:
 *		- The functions that need to be implemented based on the member type
 *			could be static methods of the DESC class.
 *
 *	Other thoughts:
 *		- It would be possible to use this for the chunk's hull tree.
 *
 *  QuadTreeMemPool and related changes:
 *		- The QuadTree was a source of many memory allocations, showing
 *			second in the list of top 32. This was because the nodes
 *			were being allocated using new and the vector of elements was
 *			growing from zero size, causing many allocations as it grew.
 *			These allocations were often scattered across address space
 *			and contributed to memory fragmentation. The performance
 *			during tree creation was not ideal either, taking
 *			up to 2ms just to add one new object in the tree.
 *		- To reduce the numbers of allocations a QuadTreeMemPool was
 *			introduced. Instead of pointers, nodes are
 *			now referenced by an index into this pool.
 *			By doing this we can generate
 *			a single memory block of nodes that grows by 50% each time
 *			the space is exhausted. This relies on the nodes and the
 *			elements to be plain old data (POD) so that the
 *			quad tree can realloc when it runs out of room.
 *			Unfortunately this has made the code harder to read.
 *		- I did try a version that did not rely on
 *			the nodes being POD and was quite successful when compiling
 *			with a C++11 compiler as move semantics reduced the amount
 *			of new being called. In the case of non C++11 there was
 *			potential to make the memory allocation problem even worse.
 *			I found in the case of BW::vector under MSVC C++11 compiler
 *			that it creates a proxy object on the heap even when the
 *			vector is empty and on the stack, so you are going to get
 *			a least two allocations associated with these, a
 *			reason I didn't continue to use them.
 *
 *	TODO:	Need to implement deletion.
