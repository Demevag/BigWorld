/*~ class BigWorld.FreeCamera
 *
 *	A FreeCamera is a camera that can be moved around using the mouse and arrow
 *	keys.  It doens't have any ties to entities, and doesn't do any physics or
 *  geometry checks, so it can be used to easily explore the world.
 *
 *	It processes both mouse and keyboard events, and consumes the events it
 *  uses.  It consumes: all mouse events, and all key events involving the
 *	arrow keys.
 *
 *
 *	It inherits from BaseCamera.
 *
 *	A FreeCamera can be created using the BigWorld.FreeCamera function.
