// Pixie Factory - documented as a module (used via import Pixie)

/*~ module Pixie
 *	Pixie provides an interface to the BigWorld client's particle
 *	systems. It exposes factory functions that provide instances
 *	of the client's base particle system and instances of modifier classes that
 *	affect the manner in which the particle system evolves over time.
 *
 *	The modifiers that affect the ParticleSystem are all derived from
 *	the ParticleSystemAction abstract base class.
