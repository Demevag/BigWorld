/**
 *	To enable support for speedtree in BigWorld, set BW_SPEEDTREE_SUPPORT to ON
 *in CMake. When speedtree suport is disabled, objects and classes from
 *  src/lib/speedtree can still be used, but they will have empty
 *implementation. To avoid interrupting the execution of its client code, it
 *will not generate errors, trigger asserts or throw exceptions, but it will
 *print warnings to the debug output.
 *
 *	To build BigWorld with support for SpeedTree, you will need SpeedTreeRT SDK
 *	4.2 or later installed and a current license. For detailed instructions on
 *how to setup SpeedTreeRT SDK, please refer to the Third Party Integrations
 *document in (bigworld/doc).
