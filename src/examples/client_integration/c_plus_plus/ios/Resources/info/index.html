<h2>About BigWorld Technology</h2>
<p> BigWorld Technology is a complete game development solution, consisting of a tightly integrated suite of high performance server applications, tools, advanced Windows 3D client and APIs designed specifically for the fast and efficient creation of MMO's and online games. We give you the power to focus tightly on your core business of game production, rather than risking your project on uncertain, expensive and time-consuming research &amp; speculative software development.
</p>
    
<h2>About this App</h2>
<p>The BigWorld Server supports clients running on Windows, PS3, Xbox 360, HTTP and iOS.  This app connects to a server that also allows PC clients to log in, and it demonstrates the basic functions of entity movement and communication. The application builds on our existing integration of BigWorld Server with PS3, Xbox360, and PC platform clients.

<h2>How to use this App</h2>
<p>Your Avatar is the icon initially in the centre of the screen.  Tap with one finger to move the Avatar.  Use two fingers to zoom in and out, and drag the view around.  Tap another icon (these are other players) to get info on them. Press the compass icon to reset the position and rotation of the camera. This will also make the camera follow the player again.
