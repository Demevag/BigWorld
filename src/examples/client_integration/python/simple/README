simple_python_client Example Code : README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is an overview of the simple_python_client example client.

It demonstrates logging in through an initial Account entity, and selection of
an appropriate character entity (called ClientAvatar in this example). There is
an example account created called 'MyAccount', which contains a reference to a 
character ClientAvatar entity called 'MyCharacter'. 

The source layout consists of the source for the simple_python_client client
executable and also the resource tree, located in the directory 
	$MF_ROOT/programming/bigworld/examples/client_integration/python/simple/res

You can inspect the account data in the 
	$MF_ROOT/programming/bigworld/examples/client_integration/python/simple/res/scripts/db.xml 
file. Note that the 'character' property of the MyAccount has the value
'MyCharacter', which is then used to load the ClientAvatar entity with its 
'playerName' property equal to 'MyCharacter'.

To run this client, do the following:

* compile the simple_python_client executable using make:
	$ cd $MF_ROOT/programming/bigworld/examples/client_integration/python/simple
	$ make

* NOTE: if the machine you are running the server on is likely to have other instances
 of the server running, you need to specify the port to run the loginApp on.
 Add the following lines to $MF_ROOT/programming/bigworld/examples/client_integration/python/simple/res/server/bw.xml:
		 <loginApp>
			<externalPorts>
			<port>[server_port]</port> <!-- Type: Integer -->
			</externalPorts>
		</loginApp>
 
* start a server instance with the resource paths set to:
	$MF_ROOT/programming/bigworld/examples/client_integration/python/simple/res:$MF_ROOT/game/res/bigworld
  Consult the Server Operations Guide for more detailed instructions on how 
  to start a server instance.
  
* once all the server components are up and running, run the
  simple_python_client executable with the same resource paths.
	$ cd $MF_ROOT/game/bin/server/<platform>/examples
	$ ./simple_python_client \
		--res $MF_ROOT/programming/bigworld/examples/client_integration/python/simple/res:$MF_ROOT/game/res/bigworld \
		-server <server_address>:<server_port> -user MyAccount -password a
 
* It will then attempt to login to the server. Amongst other debugging output
  there should be five lines printed once a second that read something like:
  	Account.chatMessage: Hello from the base: 1 
	Account.chatMessage: Hello from the base: 2
	...
	Account.chatMessage: Hello from the base: 5

  This is the initial Account entity. After 5 seconds, it will attempt to load
  a character ClientAvatar entity called MyCharacter. When the ClientAvatar
  base entity is loaded, the client will be transferred from the Account 
  base entity to that ClientAvatar base entity, and the Account base entity 
  destroyed. Once this is done, the ClientAvatar base entity creates its cell 
  entity. 
  
  We have now spawned a new character ClientAvatar entity from the Account 
  entity.

* After a second's delay, the ClientAvatar cell entity will send a chat message
  to its client entity.
  This will appear as something like:
  	ClientAvatar.fromCell: XXXX: Hello from the cell
  where XXXX is the entity ID of the character ClientAvatar entity.
