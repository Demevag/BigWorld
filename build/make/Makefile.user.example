## The intermediate output directory that will contain all .o, .d, .a files.
## To improve build speed this may be redirected to a faster filesystem such
## as a local HDD (if building from a network mount), an SSD, or a ramdisk.

## C++ compiler to use when building source code

## Toggle whether or not make should operate is silent mode by default.
## This is similar to running 'make -s' however it won't apply to sub-make
## tasks for third-party libraries.

## being non-optimal for everyday use. Enable it by uncommenting this line.

## Toggle whether or not to build unit tests as part of a regular build. This
## option should ideally be left on to avoid accidentally breaking the unit
## tests. It may be more beneficial to abitrarily disable the running of unit
## tests.

## Toggle whether or not to build with code coverage flags
#user_shouldBuildCodeCoverage := 1

## This option specifies whether to limit the build configurations that will
## attempt to run unit tests. This may be desireable for situations where
## the Debug configuration takes an exceedingly large amount of time to run the
## unit tests in comparison to the Hybrid config.
